Libbet, a character appearing as a yellow ball with two arms and a head, appears at bottom center of a floor of 4 square cells across by 4 down. Four cells are black with blue dots, four gray with horizontal lines, four light green with white checks, and four white. Above the floor is a closed door.
"Libbet can move 1 or 2 cells at once."
Libbet tucks her head in, rolls between green cells, jumps with her hands across a gray cell to another green cell, returns, and pokes her head out.
"Control Pad: Roll to next cell" (cell with arrow to adjacent cell)
"A Button and Control Pad: Jump over a cell" (two cells separated by a gray square with arch arrow)
"She moves on one shade or to the next brighter." (Black, gray, green, white, and black cells separated by arrows)
"She leaves a track when changing shades."
Libbet rolls and jumps across some cells in sequence, leaving tracks shown as white arrows.
"Holes at dead ends lead back to the start."
Libbet jumps and leaves a track toward the gray cell in a corner. A hole appears in the center, and she falls in. She is ejected at the starting point.
"Find 90 percent of possible tracks to open the exit."
Libbet leaves tracks until the total reaches 90%, the screen flashes, and the door at top opens. Then she rolls to the door.
